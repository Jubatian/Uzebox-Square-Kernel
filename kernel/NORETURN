Cross platform noreturn attribute.


To support build targets where a normal return path is taken (not by frame
reset), while the noreturn optimization can be used.


The SQ_Halt() function:

Either halts, waiting for video interrupt, or just returns (on normal return
path arch.)

An SQ_NORETURN definition is provided to apply on functions which lead towards
an SQ_Halt(). Expands to the attribute where supported, otherwise empty.


After an SQ_Halt() or an SQ_NORETURN function, nothing should be done. This
also ensures tail-chaining on targets without the feature.


Doing this way it compiles optimally on both.
