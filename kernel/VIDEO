Video mode stuff.



26 row descriptors:


byte 0: ROM tileset to use (discarded, this byte is unused)
byte 1: bits 0-2: X shift to the left
        bit    3: Enable Color 0 reload if set (Removed, global)
        bit    4: Enable sprites if set (Not implemented)
        bit    7: SPI RAM address, bank
byte 2: SPI RAM address, low
byte 3: SPI RAM address, high

Possibly I will just kill off bit 3 and 4, bit 3 becoming a global setting.
There is no much sense to these without the logical scanline system, the 200px
SPI RAM bitmap mode would be used for splitscreens.

Two other vars:

Y shift: 0-7 pixels to the top for vertical scrolling
Split point: 0 - 199 where SPI RAM bitmap mode should begin
SPI RAM bitmap start address (3 bytes).
