For some reason the .data section completely disregards any linker script
setting here, overlapping with whatever is placed in the beginning of the RAM,
no matter the method.

Maybe it will be necessary to allocate kernel stuff on the top of the RAM
instead, and place RAM tiles below that.

Probalby the key is that for some weird reason the AVR data memory starts at
0x800060, which address doesn't seem to relate anything on the real hardware.
Somebody somewhere might have placed some hack to "fix" this for the ATmega,
so it is impossible to adjust allocation by the linker script.

It just works if it is left alone.
